This is basically a weather app. It Automatically detect your current location and show weather report of your city.
Here I uses openweathermap.org Api to get weather report and for detecting the current location i uses Geolocaion Api. I also used opencagedata Api to convert Geolocation latitude and longitutde to current city that you our are in.
